Here is a description of what we were investigating in this experiment:
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px"><b>Word structure and rhyme priming</b>
<br>
<br>
This experiment was a primed lexical decision task, meaning that experimental target words were preceded by prime words, e.g. <i>dough</i> &rarr; <i>snowed</i>.
<br>
<br>
We will analyse whether presence of certain prime words influenced your response times to experimental target words. If response times to target words were faster due to presence of certain prime words, we call this a priming effect.
<br>
<br>
Priming effects for targets preceded by primes sharing a stem are well established in auditory, visual, and mixed modalities, e.g. <i>play</i> &rarr; <i>played</i> or <i>played</i> &rarr; <i>play</i> (Marslen-Wilson et al. 1994, Kouider and Dupoux 2009, Crepaldi et al. 2010). This is typically taken as evidence for decomposition of a morphologically complex word such as <i>played</i> into component stem and affix (<i>play</i> + -<i>ed</i>). Phonological priming is similarly well established for targets preceded by primes sharing a phonological rhyme (e.g. <i>clay</i> &rarr; <i>tray</i>, e.g. Radeau et al. 1995, Monsell and Hirsh 1998, Slowiaczek et al. 2000).
<br>
<br>
In previous work, we found a facilitatory priming effect for morphologically complex targets preceded by primes which rhyme with the target's stem, compared to controls (e.g. <i>dough</i> &rarr; <i>snowed</i>). In this experiment, we are investigating whether similar effects are observed for both (1) stems &rarr; words which rhyme with their past tense forms, and (2) past tense forms &rarr; words which rhyme with their stems, e.g. </p>

<ol style="margin-left: 40px">
<li> <i>sink</i> &rarr; <i>plank</i> </li>
<li> <i>sank</i> &rarr; <i>mink</i> </li>
<li> <i>snow</i> &rarr; <i>node</i> </li>
<li> <i>snowed</i> &rarr; <i>dough</i> </li>
</ol>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">We tested a range of regular and irregular verbs. This research is part of a larger project to determine the mental representations underlying word recognition. If you have any questions, you can contact Amy Goodwin Davies or Robert Wilder at embick-lab@sas.upenn.edu
